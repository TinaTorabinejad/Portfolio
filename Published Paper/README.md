# Drug Prediction Paper Accepted for IEEE Presentation and Publication

This machine learning project was performed as a class project. The project results were then written as a scientific paper, which the IEEE Conference accepted. In this project:

- Performed various types of data preprocessing techniques using different Python libraries

- Based on the performed analysis, used judgment to apply machine learning algorithms to train the model

- Analyzed the results by performing evaluation techniques such as ROC curve and loss function

- Wrote the process as a research paper, which was accepted for the 12th IEEE COMNESAT 2023 conference for presentation and publication

* The above paper will be soon available on IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar
