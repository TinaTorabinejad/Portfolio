# Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning

This project was performed in a group using Jupyter notebook.

- Used Keras library and applied the netwrok architecture to the EMNIST Letters data.
- Added TensorBoard support to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to visualize the training process.
- Added additional filters to learn features and additional hidden layers to learn combinations of features to obtain the highest possible accuracy.
- Used transfer learning & fine-tuning in the Keras to apply the existing model to the new dataset.
- Compared the result obtained from both datasets.
