# Electric Car Traveler

In this project, I worked with two classmates to design and implement an algorithm related to weighted undirected graphs.

Given a capacity C in miles that represents the maximum number of miles your electric car can drive, n cities and (n-1) distances between two consecutive cities, we designed an algorithm that outputs the list L of cities where one need to stop and charge the car such that:

1.  L is if minimum length among all possible list of cities
2.  the starting city, which is the first city, is the first element of L
3.  The destination city, which is the last city, is the last element of L
4.  If j and k are two consecutive cities in L, then when the car is in city j, the car is able to drive to city k and back to the city before city k, in case the charge station in city k is broken.

Under the Project Report I have shown the pseudocode of the algorithm that we designed and the output of the program.
