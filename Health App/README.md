# HealthApp

This application was designed for iOS users using Swift programming language.

- The app contains four tabs, and each tab functions separately.
- The app is available in both English and Spanish language
- When the user clicks on any of the buttons in the app, the callback with a proper message will display on the terminal.
- I added a logo at the top of the screen, and when the user launches the app, the logo's color changes depending on whether the user is opening the app on an iPhone or iPad.
- The app is also interactive, meaning the picture and message will change when the user clicks the next tip button.
- One of the tabs contains a map with three views: standard, hybrid, and satellite. The user can locate the closest urgent care to Cal State Fullerton on the map.
- When the user types invalid characters for the name and email fields, the program prevents the user from inputting the values.
- The weight conversion tab allows users to convert weight in Spanish and English. Also, it prevents the user from typing multiple decimals.
