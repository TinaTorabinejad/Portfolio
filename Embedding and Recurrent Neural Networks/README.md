# Embedding and Recurrent Neural Networks

This project was performed in a group using Jupyter notebook.

- Used Keras library to create recurrent neural networks to predict the quality and difficulty scores that a student will assign given the student's comments

- Documented all the results and wrote the analysis of the results by including code and visualization

- Developed and Implemented a web-scraping Python library to gather data from RateMyProfessor.com
